## Project

Expert Notes is a web application to create notes with text or transcripted audios. The project was developed during NLW Expert (ReactJS), event presented by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).

To complement the project I developed:
- info about number of notes
- batch note deletion button and dialog
- draft note in local storage
- improvements in responsiveness, accessibility and components
- improvements to the UI for writing and recording audio
- rules for closing dialog with esc and click outside

Doing:
- audio concatenation
- edit flow

Speech Recognition only works on some [browsers](developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/speechrecognition)
